My research interest lie in the behaviour of open quantum systems: that is, quantum systems that are naturally influenced by their surroundings. In many cases this induces complex behaviour that cannot be captured using traditional theoretical methods. My research seeks to develop novel theoretical tools and techniques capable of describing realistic quantum systems that couple strongly to one or more environment. I am particularly interested in how environmental interactions alter the optical properties of condensed matter systems, and how these systems may be used in quantum technologies.

I obtained my MRes and PhD from Imperial College London as part of the Controlled Quantum Dynamics Doctoral Training Center. The topic of my thesis was to develop new methods to describe open quantum system in regimes of strong system-environment coupling. Following my PhD I did a Postdoc in the group of Prof. Jesper MÃ¸rk at DTU Fotonik, Denmark, during which I developed and applied new methods to understand dephasing in semiconductor quantum dots. On my return to the UK, I did a one year postdoc at the University of Manchester in the group of Dr. Ahsan Nazir, before being awarded a research fellowship from the Royal Comission of 1851, which was based in Sheffield. From 2020-24 I held a Presidential Fellowship at the University  Manchester between the Physics & Astronomy and Electrical & Electronic Engineering departments.

I returned to the University of Sheffield in 2024 as a Senior Lecture where I established the Sheffield Open Quantum Systems group, part of the [Low Dimensional Structures and Devices group](https://ldsd.sites.sheffield.ac.uk/) and is part of the [Sheffield Quantum Centre](https://quantum.sites.sheffield.ac.uk/).
